# General
- **Timekeeping**: Every day that passes during a session is tracked, and one day passes in-game per every real-life day. The current calendar will be pinned in # adventure-journals and visible in Foundry.
- **Retainers**: The price to locate retainer applicants doubles if any retainers died in your character's care since the last hiring. Your previous retainers can be automatically re-hired for the same wages, assuming they passed their loyalty check at the end of the previous adventure.

# Character Creation
- Roll **3d6 down the line twice** for each of your character’s ability scores: Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma, which gives you two characters’ stats. Decide which of the two sets will be your primary (starting) character, and which will be secondary.
- A first level character starts with a **minimum hit point total** equal to the average starting hit point roll (3, 4, or 5).
- You can choose a **quick equipment pack** (see Foundry) to get a new character equipped quickly.
- **Detailed Encumbrance**: Treasure, weapons, and armor count toward encumbrance, movement speed is based on your weight carried, and you can carry as much as you have containers for, up to 1600 coins.

# Combat
- **To Hit**: Attacks may be resolved using your “to hit” bonus instead of the attack matrix.
- Your class's **Hit Die = your base weapon damage** (e.g., Fighters d8, Clerics d6, Magic-Users d4).
- At each Attack Bonus increase, your base **weapon damage improves** by one step, as follows:
  - 1st Bracket – 1dN where N=Class's Hit Die
  - 2nd Bracket – 1 die type up (e.g., 1d6 -> 1d8).
  - 3rd Bracket – 2dN
  - 4th Bracket – 3dN
  - 5th Bracket – 4dN
- **All classes can use all weapons**, except clerics (only blunt), knights (only melee), and small classes (cannot use longbows and two-handed swords).
- **Fighting Styles**: Classes with Dexterity as a prime requisite and a Dexterity score of 13+ can attack with two weapons (at least the off-hand weapon must have the Light property)–you still get just the one attack roll, but it’s +1 to hit. Classes with Strength as a prime requisite and a Strength score of 13+ deal +1 damage when wielding a two-handed melee weapon.
- A **Shield** grants a +1 bonus to AC, and can absorb the damage from a single blow, but then is rendered useless. Magic shields can absorb a total number of blows equal to their enchantment bonus, which diminishes one step for each blow it absorbs. The attack must be something that could logically be stopped by a shield.
- **Grappling.** The attacker(s) each make to-hit rolls. All successes roll their hit dice vs the defender's hit dice. If the sum of the attackers' dice is higher, the defender is pinned and can be killed in the next round unless help arrives or the defender breaks loose via another contested roll on its turn vs its grapplers. If the sums are exactly equal, everyone is struggling and none of them can attack with a weapon. If the defender's roll is higher, the attackers are beaten back and stunned for a number of rounds equal to the difference between the defender's roll and the attacker's rolls. (From *Swords & Wizardry*)

# Class Changes
- **Fighters** gain weapon specialization points that grants +1 to hit and damage to weapons of a particular type (e.g., swords, crossbows, axes, etc.), which can be stacked. They gain one weapon specialization point at 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th, and 13th levels.
- A **Thief** who successfully Backstabs deals 12 + STR mod flat damage. 
- **Magic-Users** and **Illusionists** use the optional Advanced Spellbook Rules (pg. 124). In addition:
  - Magic-Users and Illusionists gain Read Magic for free; other starting spells are rolled randomly.
  - Magic-Users and Illusionists can attempt to create magic items at any level.
  - If a Magic-User or Illusionist fails to learn a spell, they can attempt to learn it again if a) they gain a level, or b) they come across a different instance of the spell.
  - Magical classes may create scrolls of spells that they know for 100 gp + 1 week of time per spell level. They may research new known spells as detailed in the rules for Magical Research. They may transcribe spell scrolls they find by rolling 1d20, adding their level and INT mod (using same scale as STR melee mod). If the result is equal to or greater than 20, they learn the spell and can add it to their spellbook or, for divine casters, list of available spells. It takes 1 day of in-game time per spell level, and three tries are allowed (three failures means the scroll's magic has been dissipated, and it is destroyed).
- **Thieves**, **Acrobats**, **Assassins**, and **Barbarians**: All N-in-6 skills begin with a 1-in-6 chance of success. These classes gain expertise points as indicated below to allocate however they choose. Each point allocated to a skill improves the chance of success by 1-in-6. No skill using this system can ever increase beyond a 5 in 6 chance.
  - **Thief**: At 1st level, 6 expertise points to allocate. Every level thereafter, +2 points to allocate.
  - **Acrobat**: At 1st level, 4 expertise points to allocate. Every level thereafter, +1 point to allocate.
  - **Assassin**: At 1st level, 3 expertise points to allocate. Every level thereafter, +1 point to allocate, except at levels 5, 10, and 14.
  - **Barbarian**: At 1st level, 3 expertise points to allocate. Every odd-numbered level thereafter, a +1 point to allocate.

# Additional XP Sources
**Feats of Exploration**: Total the sum of how much XP all PCs need to advance from the start of the level at which they are currently to the next level. When a PC achieves a feat, the entire party is awarded the percentage listed of that total, which is then divided among the PCs present.
- **Rumor**: Confirm a rumor’s veracity - 2%
- **Quest**: Complete a quest - Minor 5%, Major 10%
- **Location**: Discover an important location – 5%
- **Trap**: Overcome a trap - Minor 2%, Major 5%
- **Puzzle**: Solve a puzzle - Minor 2%, Major 5%
- **Secret**: Find a secret or interpret hidden lore - 2%
- **Faction**: Manipulating or crippling a faction to your benefit - Minor 5%, Major 10%
- **NPC**: Interact beneficially with an important NPC when stakes are at play - 5%
- **Lore**: Apply in-world lore in a useful or flavorful manner - 2%
- **Haven**: Establish a reliable safe haven - 10%
- **Explore**: Explore at least five areas of a single dungeon level or at least five hexes of the overworld map - 2%
- **Skills**: Use equipment or abilities in an unorthodox yet useful manner - Minor 2%, Major 5%
- **Hazards**: Surmount an environmental obstacle or hazard - Minor 2%, Major 5% 
- **Journal**: Post (loosely) in-character writeup/recap/notes of the prior session in the #adventure-journals channel of our Discord before the day of the next session – 1% 

**PC Death**: Each surviving member of the party receives 100 XP per level of the dead character once they return to safety. However, the experience can comes with lingering mental trauma. Each survivor must save vs. Paralysis or acquire a fear of the monster, trap, or situation that caused the death. If a PC acquires a fear, any time the subject of the fear is encountered again, the PC must make a save vs. Paralysis on the spot or “freeze up” and suffer a -2 to all rolls while facing the situation. Multiple fears of the same monster/trap/situation can stack! A PC can deal with their fear (permanently remove it) by spending gold pieces in town (drinking, partying, gambling, praying, tithing, etc.) equal to the amount of XP gained. 

**Example*: Ruddiger, a 4th level Fighter, falls into a pit trap to his death. Once back in town, as his friends reflect on their adventure and each gain 400 XP, each party member rolls a save vs. Paralysis. Brahm fails his save and acquires a fear of pit traps. He does not have the wealth to “deal with” his fear so has to live with it for now. On the next adventure, Brahm finds himself having to face his fear and jump over a similar pit trap. Brahm rolls to save vs. Paralysis and fails. He suffers a -2 on the task of jumping the pit trap due to his fear.*

**Philanthropy**: Donate money to the poor/church/Crown/guild/tavern to earn 1 XP per 5gp spent. 
If a PC donates a total of more than 600gp in a single village, 1200 in a town, 2000 in a city, or 3000 in a metropolis, they must roll on the following consequences table:


| 1d6 | Result | 
| --- | --- |
| 1 | The populace resents your wealth and condescending manner of spending it. -1 to social rolls in the settlement, and you may never practice philanthropy here again. |
| 2 | The populace appreciates the generosity, but thinks your motives are self-serving. -1 to social rolls in the settlement. |
| 3-4 | The populace knows you by name in this settlement. |
| 5 | Your generosity is lauded by the populace. +1 to social rolls in this settlement. |
| 6 | Your name is recognized by everyone within 30 miles. +1 to social rolls within this area, and mundane goods are 10% cheaper. |

# Wilderness Travel
The party has multiple activities in which they can engage in the wilderness:
- **Travel Activities**. The party can travel for two quarter days, three if forced march (they must rest a whole day afterwards). Each character (incl. retainers) can perform only one activity:
  - **Forage**: 1-in-6 chance to find food for 1d6 humans (Rangers & Barbarians have a 2-in-6 chance).
  - **Navigate**: Decreases this chance of being lost by 1, to a minimum of 1-in-6.
  - **Keep Watch**: Each character keeping watch reduces the 4-in-6 chance of being surprised in an encounter by 1, to a minimum of 1-in-6.
  - **Make a Map**: Decreases the chance of being lost by 1, to a minimum of 1-in-6.
- **Quarter Day Activities**. Cannot travel during that quarter day (6 hrs). Hazard dice are rolled as usual.
  - **Explore**: Explore the area to uncover any hidden features it might have.
  - **Hunt**: 1-in-6 chance to encounter animals suitable for eating (1d4xHD rations) in the wild. A Barbarian or Ranger has a 5-in-6 chance. Especially well-stocked hunting grounds also increases this chance by +1-3.
  - **Forage**: Several adventurers can forage at once, each having a 1-in-6 chance of finding 1d6 standard rations' worth of food. Rangers & Barbarians have a 2-in-6 chance.
  - **Rest/Sleep**: Characters must rest for one quarter day each day or suffer a cumulative penalty of -1 to hit, damage, save, and skill rolls each quarter day until they have rested. Each quarter day's rest will remove 1 point from that penalty.
- **Day Activities**. Takes an entire day, during which the party cannot travel:
   - **Rest**: Characters must rest for one day per six days of travel or suffer a penalty of -1 to hit and damage rolls until they have rested for one full day. Only hazard dice are rolled, ignoring any 5s.
