# General

- **Timekeeping**: Every day that passes during a session is tracked, and one day passes in-game per every real-life day. The current calendar will be pinned in # adventure-journals and visible in Foundry.
- **Sessions must end in safety**: Sessions must end with the PCs in a place of safety. (See "Escaping the Dungeon" below.)

# Bonus XP

| Experience | XP (per character) | 
| --- | --- |
| Post (loosely) in-character writeup/recap/notes of the session in the # adventure-journals channel| +10% XP boost next session|
| Explore and map the wilderness (requires using the "explore" quarter-day action) | 10 XP per hex |
| Explore and map caves/dungeons | 10 XP per room |
| Clear a wilderness hex of monster lairs | 25 XP |
| Donate money to the poor/church/Crown/guild/tavern | 1 XP per 5 gp |
| Death of a Player Character (see below) | 100 XP x Level |

*PC Death*: When a PC dies, each surviving member of the party receives the above listed XP bonus as lessons learned from the tragedy once they return safely back to town. However, the experience comes with lingering mental trauma. Each survivor must make a Saving Throw vs. Paralysis or acquire a fear of the monster, trap, or situation that caused the death. If a PC acquires a fear, any time the subject of the fear is encountered again, the PC must make a save vs. Paralysis on the spot or “freeze up” and suffer a -2 (or -10%) to all rolls while facing the situation. Multiple fears of the same monster/trap/situation can stack! A PC can work through and deal with their fear (permanently remove it) by spending gold pieces frivolously in town (drinking, partying, gambling, praying, tithing, etc.) equal to the amount of XP gained. Experience cannot be gained in this way from hireling deaths.

*Example*: Ruddiger, a 4th level Fighter, falls into a pit trap to his death. Once back in town, as his friends reflect on their adventure and each gain 400 XP, each party member rolls a save vs. Paralysis. Brahm fails his save and acquires a fear of pit traps. He does not have the wealth to “deal with” his fear so has to live with it for now. On the next adventure, Brahm finds himself having to face his fear and jump over a similar pit trap. Brahm rolls to save vs. Paralysis and fails. He suffers a -2 on the task of jumping the pit trap due to his fear.

# Characters

- **Re-rolling hp 1s and 2s**: During character creation, hp rolls of 1 or 2 (before applying any CON modifier) may be re-rolled.
- **Spells & Scrolls**: Magical classes may create scrolls of spells that they know for 100 gp + 1 week of time per spell level. They may research new known spells as detailed in the rules for Magical Research. They may transcribe spell scrolls they find by rolling 1d20, adding their level and INT mod (using same scale as STR melee mod). If the result is equal to or greater than 20, they learn the spell and can add it to their spellbook or, for divine casters, list of available spells. It takes 1 day of in-game time per spell level, and three tries are allowed (three failures means the scroll's magic has been dissipated, and it is destroyed).
- **d6 Thief Skills**: All thief skills (climb sheer surfaces, find or remove treasure traps, hear noise, hide in shadows, move silently, open locks, pick pockets, read languages) begin with a 1-in-6 chance of success. Thieves gain expertise points--four at 1st level, and two more each level-up--to allocate however they choose. Each point allocated to a skill improves the chance of success by 1-in-6. No skill may be raised above 5-in-6. *(From Carcass Crawler 1)* - This also applies to Assassin skills, except Assassination.
- **Basic encumbrance**: Only treasure counts, and you can carry as much as you have containers for, up to 1600 coins.
- **Quick Equipment Packs**: You can elect to choose a quick equipment pack to get a new character up and running quickly. Details are in Foundry.

# Combat

- **Arcane spell casters and staves:** Illusionists and magic-users can wield a staff in combat.
- **Fighting styles**: "Dual wielding” weapons (13 DEX req) – you still get just the one attack roll, but it’s +1 to hit. “Great weapons” (13 STR req) – you can wield a heavy two-handed weapon for +1 damage.
- **Fighters** may make one attack per Fighter level each round against creatures with 1 HD or less.
- **Shields Shall Be Splintered**: Characters can elect to have their shield be destroyed to negate all damage from a single blow. The attack must be something that could logically be stopped by a shield.
- **THAC0/Target 20**. Instead of referring to the attack matrix, attacks may be resolved using THAC0 and/or the Target 20 system (Roll+modifiers+AC. If it hits 20, the attack hits).
- **Grappling.** The attacker(s) each make to-hit rolls. All successes roll their hit dice vs the defender's hit dice. If the sum of the attackers' dice is higher, the defender is pinned and can be killed in the next round unless help arrives or the defender breaks loose via another contested roll on its turn vs its grapplers. If the sums are exactly equal, everyone is struggling and none of them can attack with a weapon. If the defender's roll is higher, the attackers are beaten back and stunned for a number of rounds equal to the difference between the defender's roll and the attacker's rolls. *(From Swords & Wizardry)*

# Escaping the Dungeon

There are three ways in which a gaming session can end:

1) The players can, at any time of their choosing, make their way back to town and end the session for the evening.

2) As the referee, I can, at any time of my choosing, announce that we will stop playing in 1 hour. If, by the end of the hour, the PCs have made their way out of the dungeon, the session ends normally. (Basically, this is 1 hour before our scheduled end of session.)

3) If the PCs have not made their way out of the dungeon (for whatever reason), then the Escaping the Dungeon! tables will be used to determine their fate.

>*If a PC ends a session within one hex or dungeon level per character level of a known safe haven, they automatically return home safely. So a 1st level PC ending in the wilderness one hex from home, a 2nd level PC ending on the first level of a dungeon one hex from home, and a 4th level PC ending on the second level of a dungeon two hexes from home would all automatically get home safely.*

## Escape Check

|SITUATION|CHANCE OF ESCAPE|
|---|---|
|You don't know where you are.|25%|
|You know where you are.|50%|
|You have a clear, mapped, and unhindered path of escape.|75%|

**CHALLENGE ADJUSTMENT**: Adjust the chance of escape by +/- 10% multiplied by the difference between the average CR of the local opposition and the level of the character. (For example, a 5th-level character facing CR 7 opponents would suffer a -20% adjustment on their chance of escape. In a classic dungeon scenario, you can make this adjustment using the dungeon level — a 5th-level character on the 3rd level of the dungeon would enjoy a +20% adjustment on their chance of escape, for example.)

**SMALL COMPLEX**: If the characters are attempting to escape from a lair or other small complex, increase the chance of success by 10% to 20%.

**MAKING THE CHECK**: An escape check is made for each character separately. There is always a minimum 1% chance of escape or failure. On a failed escape check, roll 1d10 on the _Failed Escape_ table below.

## Failed Escapes

|1d10|RESULT|
|---|---|
|1|You escape **unharmed.**|
|2|You escape but have been permanently **altered** (maimed, permanently polymorphed, replaced with a double, etc.).|
|3|You escape but have been **injured**. You suffer 1d6 x 1d6 points of damage. (If this kills you, see result #8.)|
|4|You have **lost 1d6 pieces of equipment**. Determine randomly between slots and bags. If a bag is lost, all of its contents are lost with it.|
|5|You have been captured, petrified, or otherwise **trapped**. Roll the escape percentile again to see if your comrades know where you are. If they do not, roll the escape percentile again to see if your comrades have a clue of some sort.|
|6|You have become **lost.**|
|7|You have been transformed into a **monster** (undead, lycanthrope, mind controlled, etc.).|
|8-9|You have **died**. Roll the escape percentile again to see if your comrades were able to retrieve your body. (Instead of retrieving your body, your comrades may choose to loot it and/or leave it.) If they did not, roll the escape percentile again to see if your comrades know where your body is. If they do not, there is a 50% chance that your body has been utterly destroyed.|
|10|Opportunity for **betrayal**. You can choose to either reroll on this table or betray a comrade who would otherwise escape. If you choose to betray a comrade roll 1d6 -- on a roll of 1-4, you escape and they must roll on this table; on a roll of 5-6, both you and your victim suffer the fate they roll.|

**DESIGN NOTES**

The primary goal of this little sub-system is not to punish the players. However, it is designed to provide them with a meaningful motivation to leave the dungeon in a timely fashion. Failing that, it is designed to provide interesting consequences that (frequently) can be followed up on subsequent forays into the dungeon — whether that’s recovering lost equipment, ransoming a lost comrade, or the like.

The actual chance of outright dying, you’ll note is quite slim. If the escape check is the standard value of 50% (and it will usually be higher), then your chance of dying is only about 10% vs. a 55%
